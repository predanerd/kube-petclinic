# Running petclinic app via Actions and minikube

This repo borrows code from [spring projects](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic) for the intention to learn how to use minikube and Github Actions together.

.github/workflows/minikube_test.yml is the result. This contains all the necessary codes to start a cluster, setting up the database and deployment configs and eventually deploy to then do a basic curl test.
